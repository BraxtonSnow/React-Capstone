        <h5>Capstone Process</h5>
        <p>
          As I pondered the process in which I wanted to take on this Project, I
          first glanced over the instructions to build my wireframe. The
          wireframe has been a challenge creating the outline that I wanted to
          follow. The changes needing to be done to the wireframe was
          unexpected, especially after building the individual pages and testing
          the functionality. The useState and functions proved to be more tricky
          when trying to figure out how to pass them as props from one child to
          another. Then trying to return it back to the parent to then be passed
          to another child. If you take a look at my App.js and how it is
          working with Products.js, Cart.js and CardComp.js

        <p>
          There were a variety of challenges in the frontend course that I
          faced. Was it difficult learning multiple languages in a short amount
          of time? Yes it was. Although there were difficulties keeping up with
          the amount of material presented to us and our instructor swithed out
          mid course, I was able to be stretched further than I have gone before
          with technology and Web-Development. This course pushed me ways that
          allowed me to develop the skills needed to have the ability to take on{" "}
