          As I pondered the process in which I wanted to take on this Project, I
          first glanced over the instructions to build my wireframe. The
          wireframe has been a challenge creating the outline that I wanted to
          follow. The changes to the wireframe was unexpected, especially after
          building the individual pages and testing the functionality. The
          useState and functions proved to be more tricky when trying to figure
          out how to pass them as props from one child to another. Then trying
          to return it back to the parent to then be passed to another child. If
          you take a look at my App.js and how it is working with Products.js,
          Cart.js and CardComp.js
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
